Holgate Brewhouse

79 High St, Woodend VIC 3442

Come see the microbrewery in action at the Hotel. You’ll find us out back dreaming up another mighty brew, wrangling with the bottling machine or otherwise cranking out some more Holgate tasty beers. Blow the froth off a couple while you’re here and enjoy some fine cuisine in the Hotel restaurant. Stay a night or two in one of our beautifully refurbished guest rooms. Best of all, visit our bar and taproom and discover just how fresh and full-flavoured authentic craft beer can be – Straight from the Gate!

We make our beers entirely ourselves, bold and brimming with character - carefully constructed with authentic, natural ingredients. We reckon there’s more than enough industrially-brewed beerish-flavoured bunk in the world. If that makes us beer snobs, it’s a badge we wear with pride. No preservatives. No chemicals. No pasteurisation. Just years of brewing lore and an uncompromising approach.

Yep, since start-up in 1999 in Paul and Natasha Holgate’s back-yard, Holgate Brewhouse brewing company has been producing genuine craft beer from the village of Woodend in Victoria. Brewed, bottled and kegged right here, our beers come straight to you from our family-owned brewery, which we’re stoked to have installed in the awesome 19th century red- brick Hotel in Woodend.
