Your Third Voice Podcast is education and inspiration for your inner mentor.
We have three voices. The first is the voice we use to speak. The second is the voice inside our mind, the one we use to talk to ourselves. The third is our inner mentor, our intuition, that guides the decisions for how we lead our lives. The aim of Your Third Voice is to be a guide for your inner mentor. We aim to provide the tools necessary for your inner mentor to learn and be inspired so you can grow, teach others and expand your experiences.

Catchy message (thoughts/feedback welcome)
